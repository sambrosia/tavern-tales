If you like, contracts and agreements you sign or mediate are magically enforced. They can't be violated by any means (Agreeing to the contract "You can't speak of an event" means you literally lose the ability to speak of it forever). The contract or agreement must mention that the terms are binding. 

* *Describe*: Signing a pact in blood, binding their soul to service, write your contract into universal laws.
