You can spend reagents to create thermite. Anyone can spend about 1 minute setting it up to activate it. Once activated, it slowly and continuously burns a one-space tunnel through absolutely anything in whatever direction the user likes for several minutes. Thermite is absolutely unstoppable until it naturally burns out.
