Show your gaming group a "Comedy and Tragedy" token. At any point, give it to the GM to tell a free Good Tale; take it from the GM to have the GM tell a free Bad Tale. Start each session with the token in your possession.

* *Describe*: How your fortune turns, an exciting plot twist, a shift in tone, poetic justice, how fate intervenes.
