Gain the defense "Pacifist []." Mark it when you suffer a Bad Tale while pursuing nonviolence or showing mercy. 

When you do, name an immediate impending threat; it won't come to pass, or it will be much less severe if it does come to pass (GM's choice).

* *Describe*: Extending your hand to an enemy, disarming a foe and leaving them unharmed, seeking peace.
