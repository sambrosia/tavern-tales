You can vanish and take control of a corpse or vulnerable creature. Use its stats and traits instead of your own, but you retain this trait. If the body you're possessing has more XP than you, gain a condition you can't remove until you end the possession. Your host can attempt to rebel against your possession. 

* *Describe*: Overpowering its soul, becoming a spirit and moving inside of it, infecting its thoughts.
