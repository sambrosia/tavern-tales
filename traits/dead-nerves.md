Gain the defense "Dead Nerves []." Mark it when you suffer a Bad Tale that an undead creature could ignore. If that Bad Tale gave you a condition, completely ignore all negative effects associated with that condition.

* *Describe*: Ignoring a fatal wound, unnatural resilience, undead anatomy, your rotten organs.
* *Ignore*: Your guts spilling out, carry around your decapitated head, ignore a sword through your heart.
