You can put a smaller creature inside of you. They can't escape until you're defeated or you let them, and they gain the condition "Crushed" or "Digested" (your choice) while inside of you. However, physical conditions that they inflict on you are much worse than normal.

* *Describe*: Swallowing someone whole, wrapping with tentacles, constricting them with your snake-body.
