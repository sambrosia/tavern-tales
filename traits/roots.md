You can root yourself to the ground. You can't be forcibly moved unless the ground you're rooted to is moved. While rooted, you have the defense "Rooted [][][]." Mark it when you suffer a Bad Tale related to physical harm.

* *Describe*: Joining with the earth, entrenching into the ground, growing roots and vines that grab on.
