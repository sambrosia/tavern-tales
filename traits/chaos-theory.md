You can do something mundane to begin a chain of events (max 1). Every 30 minutes or so (real-time), the next player to the left rolls to determine how the chain of events escalates. Good Tales make the chain better; Bad Tales make the chain worse. At any point, you can make a final roll to end the chain of events. 

* *Begin the Chain*: Pet a dog, give a beggar a gold coin,  drop a nail, fire an arrow randomly into the distance.
* *Describe*: Manipulating events, embracing the random chaos of the universe, relying on pure luck.End the Chain: Help arrives, something explodes, someone dies, a building collapses, a war starts.
