You can illuminate something in bright light, which lasts for as long as you want. Collaborate on something very general and vague that causes the light to change color or glow more brightly. Also, collaborate on what causes the light to fade.

* *Changing Light*: Someone's approaching, you have strayed from the path, there's hidden danger here. 
* *Describe*: Your eyes glowing with divine light, seeing the world as your deity sees it, knowing the one truth.
* *Fade*: Time, the light is exposed to something your deity despises, the sun sets, the light can be washed off.
