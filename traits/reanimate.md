Collaborate on a death condition and how quickly you reanimate. If you die and your death condition isn't met, you return to life.

* *Death Condition*: Staked in the heart, decapitated, killed when your phylactery is destroyed, poisoned.
* *Describe*: Crawling out of a shallow grave, coalescing from death, pulling yourself out of the spirit realm.
