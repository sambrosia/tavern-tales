Whenever you or one of your closest allies would die, they instead hold onto life for several minutes or hours, depending on the severity of their injuries. During this time, they can be healed as normal to potentially avoid 
death. Also, the GM must answer honestly whenever you ask how close a creature is to death. 

* *Describe*: Hiding them from Death, altering their anatomy, extending their life with necromancy.
