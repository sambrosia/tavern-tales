You can spend resources to fortify a location beyond what is normally possible. Collaborate on what fortifications you can provide, and how you achieve them.

* *Defenses*: Walls withstand siege attacks, there's an anti-magic field, your moat attracts magic beasts.
* *Describe*: Buttressing the structure, casting protective wards, consecrating the land, infusing it with magic.
