Draw a symbol next to 3 of your inventory slots. Items you place in these slots vanish from reality (but still occupy slots). No one else can access these items. Whenever you want, you can call any of these items to your person, or make them vanish again.

* *Describe*: A sword appearing in your hand, summoning your hammer from the heavens, morphin' time.
