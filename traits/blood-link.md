You can link 2 willing creatures, designating one as the giver and the other as the receiver. Any harm the giver suffers is instead transferred to the receiver. The link ends when either person wants it to end. If you link a defeated creature, they don't have to be willing and the link doesn't end when they want it to. Collaborate on what ends it.

* *Describe*: Stitching their souls together, creating a thaumaturgic link, altering the strands of destiny.
