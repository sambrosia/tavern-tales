You can baptize an item worth at least 1 treasure in the blood of worthy foes (literally or metaphorically). The item becomes your banner (max 1). You and allies each gain the defense "Under a Banner []." Mark it when you suffer a Bad Tale related to battle while the banner is visible. If it's lost or destroyed, you and allies gain the condition "Demoralized" until it's replaced. Banners are inherently flashy and attract enemies' attention.

* *Banner*: Flag, coat of arms, shield with an emblazoned symbol, glowing arcane symbol, skull on a pike. 
* *Describe*: Waving a banner, getting inspiration from a greater cause, holding it above the battlefield.
