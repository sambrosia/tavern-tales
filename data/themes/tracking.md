Some look out into the horizon and see only uncertainty and danger. They turn their backs on the unknown and opt for the safety of a simple life. But not trackers. These courageous trailblazers gaze into the wilderness and see a world filled with adventure, opportunities, and wonder. They have climbed the tallest mountain and looked down upon the world like gods. They have plumbed the deepest caves to unearth secrets never intended to see the light of day. They have crossed the widest oceans to discover unknown lands. Trackers' motives are as diverse as the regions they explore. Some hunt elusive game animals. Some seek the bounty of a wanted criminal. A chosen few are simply in it for the thrill of discovery. So, strap on those well-worn boots and grab your traveling pack! What will you discover as you explore the great unknown?
