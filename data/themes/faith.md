name: Faith

Some say that you can measure a person by their friends. If that's true, then what can you say of someone who has forged an alliance with the gods themselves? Such is the power of the faithful. These conduits of divine might spread their god's dogma throughout the land, sharing blessings with their brothers and smiting foul heathens with righteous fury. The gods are eager to share their power with devoted followers... but which deity will you champion?

* The orc shaman of a tribe communes with spirits to determine the best time to march to war.

* A cleric prays to a pantheon of gods, requesting that they aid him on his mission.

* A devout paladin leads an inquisition against heathens who would dare defy the will of his god.
