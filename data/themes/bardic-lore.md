name: Bardic Lore

Truly, the pen is mightier than the sword. Just think of how many people have been sent to their deaths at the stroke of a pen, how many marriages have crumbled because of a romantic poem, and how many plans have been ruined due to a clever lie. Those who pursue the subtle arts of bardic lore understand the true value of people, wielding inspiration like a blade and intrigue like a shield. With a pen in your hand, a sword on your belt, and a song (or perhaps a maiden) on your lips, how will you write your own legend? 

* A witty jester entertains the king with his jokes, all while subtly influencing the wealthy elite.

* A bright-eyed bard travels the land, learning new legends and singing songs of lost heroes.

* With his rapier and his feathered cap, a dashing swashbuckler is a danger to seedy criminals and lovelorn maidens... but for very different reasons.
