Once each time while hiding, you can perform an action that would normally break stealth and reveal your location without breaking stealth. Absurdly obvious actions (jumping on a table and yelling) will reveal you as normal.

* *Describe*: Returning to the shadows, doing something before anyone notices, waiting for the perfect moment.
