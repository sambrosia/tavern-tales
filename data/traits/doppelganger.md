Write your personal XP total on your character sheet. When you kill a creature, you can have the GM give you their character sheet. You become identical to them in every way and use their character sheet. Transfer your gear, personal XP, and this trait to the new character sheet. If your new character sheet has more XP than your personal XP, gain a condition that you can't remove until you change character sheets. You can return to your original character sheet at any point, but you forever lose the stolen character sheet. 

* *Describe*: Stealing their whole identity, changing your form, absorbing their essence, changing skin.
