When you extensively observe something, you're bolstered to confront, overcome, or avoid that thing. The longer you observe, the more bolsters you accrue (max 5). You can report your findings to transfer any of these accrued bolsters to others.

* *Describe*: Following enemy troop movements, scouting ahead, patrolling the wilderness for your prey.
