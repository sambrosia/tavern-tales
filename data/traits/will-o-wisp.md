You can create a will-o-wisp, which is a very small but eye-catching guide. Name someone and describe something. The wisp will intelligently guide that person to the closest place that matches your description. It has supernatural knowledge and can locate anything that isn't hidden. They fulfill their purpose eternally unless you dismiss them or they're destroyed.

* *Commands*: Bring villagers here, lure bandits to my trap, bring my allies to me, guide me to safety. 
* *Describe*: Conjuring a mote of light, following a bird, calling a pixie to serve you, following a shooting star.
