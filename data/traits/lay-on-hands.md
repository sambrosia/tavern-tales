You can touch someone to heal 1 of their physical or spiritual conditions. Then, the GM tells them how long they're immune to your Lay on Hands (the stronger the condition, the longer the immunity). 

* *Describe*: Your hands glowing with radiant warmth, pouring your deity's energy through your body.
