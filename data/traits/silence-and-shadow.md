If you like, everything you do is completely noiseless. Also, you can dim or extinguish a visible light source until someone takes the time to rekindle the light. You can't dim celestial bodies, such as the sun.

* *Describe*: Landing like a cat, snuffing out a candle, using shadow-magic on a torch, spreading gloom.
