Gain the defense "Tumble []." Mark it when you suffer a Bad Tale that you can logically dodge. When you do, remove or temporarily suppress (whichever is more logical) a condition that restricts your movement, and you can immediately move.

* *Describe*: Diving out the way, running for safety, swinging away on a rope or vine, ducking into a ditch.
