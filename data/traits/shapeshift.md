Create a second character sheet that always has the same XP as your main character. You can shift forms, changing character sheets in the process. Keep your conditions, marked boxes, and gear. Collaborate on how this trait works.

* *Describe*: Twisting and reshaping your skin, rapidly evolving, switching places with your shadow.
* *How it Works*: You can't control when you transform, your alternate form is bloodthirsty, shifting drains you.
