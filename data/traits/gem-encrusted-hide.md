You can destroy a magic item to make it permanently part of you, as if you are now the magic item. When you're slain, the items (or at least the parts necessary to reforge them) can be recovered from your corpse.

* *Describe*: Magic coursing through your veins, feeding on raw energy, storing treasure inside of your body.
