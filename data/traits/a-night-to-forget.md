Whenever you engage in drunken revelry, you can announce it's a night to forget. The GM tells you where you wake up and gives you 1 condition. Write on your character sheet that you have 1 fuzzy memory (max 5). Cross off a fuzzy memory to suddenly remember what you did that night, and how your actions that night somehow benefit your current situation.

* *Describe*: Buying drinks for everyone, going bar hopping, visiting the brothel, throwing a wild party. 
* *Benefits*: You've been here before, you seduced the evil villain, there's a magic item in your pocket.
