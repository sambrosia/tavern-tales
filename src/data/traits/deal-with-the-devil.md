After talking to someone, you can learn the one thing that they want more than anything else. If you provide them with that thing, you gain complete and total control over them; the GM or player hands control of that character over to you. 

* *Describe*: Purchasing their soul, making an offer they can't refuse, eternally enslaving them to your will.
