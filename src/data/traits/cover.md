When you're behind cover that you've never used with this trait before, gain the defense "Cover []." Mark it when you suffer a Bad Tale that can be mitigated by that cover. Moving to sufficiently different cover gives you a new defense with an unmarked box. 

* *Describe*: Diving behind a wall, ducking under a bush, crouching behind a cart, hiding in a trench.
