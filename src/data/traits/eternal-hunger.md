You no longer need to eat or drink. Collaborate on 1 new need that you must fulfill at least once a week or starve. When you excessively indulge this need, you heal as if you received 1 day of bed rest and medical attention, and you're bolstered to do anything.

* *Describe*: Cold skin, no pulse, you don't bleed when you're cut, obsessive desire, growling stomach.
* *New Needs*: Drink blood, eat nightmares, consume souls, feast on fear, absorb magic, devour nightmares.
