After you defeat a worthy foe or accomplish a worthy deed, write it on your character sheet. Cross it off to share the story with others. Their disposition toward you significantly improves, or they're intimidated by you and back down (their choice). 

* *Describe*: Telling them your body count, explaining what true danger really is, telling tales in a tavern.
