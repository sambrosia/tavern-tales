You can take a dying or recently dead creature's soul. Write it on your character sheet (max 5). Others can't interact with the soul (such as to resurrect it or communicate with it) without your consent. Also, you can forever obliterate the soul to temporarily gain some of its power. Collaborate on what that entails.

* *Describe*: Soul strands rising to your clenched fist, capturing its spirit in a gem, devouring its essence.
* *Power*: Increase one of your stats, bolster to do what it did well, gain a temporary trait, summon its spirit.
