You can write down an event that's out of your control. Seal it in a document with a code name on it and give it (max 5) to the GM. When the event happens, the GM opens the document and reads it. If the GM agrees that you predicted the event, tell as many Good Tales as you like until the odds are significantly in your favor. 

* *Describe*: Creating a master plan, building contingencies, creating Plan B, preparing for the future.
