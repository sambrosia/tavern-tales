If nobody has seen you for several minutes, you can vanish without a trace. Nobody knows where you are (including the GM), so you skip all of your turns. At any point, reappear anywhere that you logically could have reached during that time.

* *Describe*: Throwing down a smoke bomb, disappearing into a forest, emerging when they least expect it.
