Give one of your weapons a name. It is now a magic item, but only in your hands. Collaborate on its effects. Absolutely nothing can forcibly remove it from you. If lost, it miraculously finds its way back to you in less than a day.

* *Describe*: Performing a sacred blade ritual, carving the weapon's name into it, baptizing the weapon in blood.Miraculous Return: Trip over it in the woods, find it on the next corpse you loot, find it for sale in a shop.
