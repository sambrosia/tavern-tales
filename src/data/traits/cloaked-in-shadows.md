Gain the defense "Cloaked in Shadows []." Mark it when you suffer a Bad Tale while hidden or obscured. Then, you vanish; not even the GM knows where you are. On your next turn, tell the GM where you're hiding (though you can stay hidden in your new location if you like). 

* *Describe*: Ducking into the shadows, taking a glancing blow from their bad aim, repositioning to a better spot.
