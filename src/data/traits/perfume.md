You can give something an incredibly pleasant or unpleasant scent for about 1 day. If it's pleasant, creatures are inexplicably drawn to the scent and gain the desire to possess the scent's source. If it's repulsive, creature are disgusted by it and don't want to be near it. This may have the opposite effect on creatures like undead and vermin that are attracted to disgusting smells. 

* *Describe*: Heavenly scent, heady aroma, relaxed and pleasant feeling, euphoria, being light headed.
