You can save someone from any threat imaginable. However, your fates are now intertwined until both of you are completely safe and have no conditions. If one of you gains a condition or dies while your fates are intertwined, the other does as well. You can't use this trait on someone if your fates are already intertwined.

* *Describe*: Leaping to their rescue, dragging your ally to safety, grabbing them as they fall over a cliff ledge.
