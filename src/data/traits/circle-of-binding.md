You can walk in a circle. When you're finished, create a barrier along the circle. Absolutely nothing can cross the barrier except light and sound. Collaborate on what breaks the circle.

* *Breaks the Circle*: Time passes, an item touches it, you touch the circle, a secret word is spoken, night falls.
* *Describe*: Drawing runes in chalk, lighting candles in a ring, creating a magic circle, using pact magic.
