When the GM agrees that you significantly advance your deity's dogma, write on your character sheet that you hold your deity's favor. Cross it off to perform a powerful miracle that falls under your deity's domains. 

* *Describe*: Praying to your deity for sacred power, serving as a conduit for divine wrath, doing the impossible.
* *Miracles*: Resurrect the fallen, receive a vision, know the divine truth, banish a heathen to another realm.
