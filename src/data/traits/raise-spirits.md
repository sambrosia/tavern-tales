Alcoholic drinks heal you as if they're healing potions (refer to the Alchemy theme), except that they give you the condition "Drunk" instead of "Hungry and tired." 

* *Describe*: Drinking to dull the pain, celebrating with a cold one, chugging, being a typical adventurer.
* *Drinks*: A bottle of wine, a massive stein of ale, a flask of liquor, a line of shots, a few mixed drinks.
