You can see through materials. Collaborate on what material you can't see through.

* *Can't See Through*: Metal, wood, magic, stone, organic matter, smooth surfaces, things that are green.
* *Describe*: Donning X-ray goggles, emitting X-ray pulses, peering through a magic gem, your eyes changing color.
