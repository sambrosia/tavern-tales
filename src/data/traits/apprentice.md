You can designate 1 of your minions (max 1) as your apprentice. Their disposition toward you significantly improves and the end of their contract becomes "in exchange for guidance and hands-on training." When you gain XP, your apprentice gains that much XP as well. 

* *Describe*: Leading by example, explaining the intricacies of your craft, testing their skills, bonding with them.
