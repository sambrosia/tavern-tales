name: Transformation

Adapt to survive; this is a fundamental rule of the universe. Each new sunrise brings with it the chaos of infinite possibilities: your closest friend could betray you; nations could rise or fall; a new discovery could revolutionize our understanding of the universe. You could either futilely cling to the old ways as the future renders you obsolete, or you can adapt, evolve, and transform yourself to thrive in this new world. Shifters embrace the chaos of change. When they gaze into tomorrow, they imagine the countless possibilities of what they could become: king, assassin, lover, hero, villain - everything and anything. These shifters understand that chaos flows both ways. The future has the power to change us, but we also have the power to change the future. Are you strong enough to change the world?
