Alchemists create new wonders in ways that artists could never hope to match, brewing new chemicals that were heretofore unseen. When you understand the inner workings of the universe, the possibilities are endless: you could bottle sunlight, brew glory, or even unlock the hidden process for turning lead into gold. So, master chemist, what will you brew into your next bubbling concoction? </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>A hermit lives in the swamp, where he brews fish eyes, pickled fireflies, and muddy water into potent elixirs.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>A chemist travels the world in search of rare and exotic materials to create the elixir of eternal youth.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>Hidden in her secret lair, an assassin creates deadly poisons for her next kill.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Arcane&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>There are some who seek to look beyond the veil to unravel the mysteries of the universe, unlocking ancient power that was never intended to fall into mortal hands. These masters of the arcane arts bend the universe to their will by breaking the laws of physics and inventing new laws at whim. They fling fireballs as easily as an archer might launch an arrow. They warp space and time to create portals that span across continents. They bind their enemies under powerful spells to leave them as helpless as newborn kittens. Do you dare to rip apart the fabric of spacetime to tinker with reality? Unfathomable power awaits those foolish or brave enough to try.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An aged wizard spends his days poring over tomes to create a new spell.</li>\\n<li>A war mage devastates his foes with orbs of raw energy and powerful hexes.</li>\\n<li>A scientist researches bizarre magical anomalies hoping for the next big scientific breakthrough.</li>\\n</ul>\\n&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Artifice&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>Soldiers often say that the sword doesn&#39;t make the man, arguing that skill at arms is more important than strength of steel. Artificers roll their eyes at that statement or at least, they would if they weren&#39;t too busy carving magic runes into a indestructible sword. Or setting enchanted rubies into a suit of armor that renders the wearer immune to fire. Or placing gears into a steam-powered bull large enough to level a fortress. Those who doubt the power of  craftsmanship have clearly never experienced the beauty of creation. Truly, a single act of creation can change the world. How will you leave your mark? Will you build something that world has never before seen? Will you forge a sword capable of slaying dragons? Will you construct thick city walls to protect those you love? Fire up the forges, young artisan, and prove to the gods you, too, have mastered the art of creation!</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>A legendary blacksmith carves ancient runes into weapons, imbuing them with powerful magic.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>After losing his arm to a dragon, a warrior builds a clockwork arm for himself and sets out to even the score.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>A mad scientist experiments with bizarre gadgets and gizmos, pushing the limits of science and morality.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bardic Lore&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>Truly, the pen is mightier than the sword. Just think of how many people have been sent to their deaths at the stroke of a pen, how many marriages have crumbled because of a romantic poem, and how many plans have been ruined due to a clever lie. Those who pursue the subtle arts of bardic lore understand the true value of people, wielding inspiration like a blade and intrigue like a shield. With a pen in your hand, a sword on your belt, and a song (or perhaps a maiden) on your lips, how will you write your own legend? </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>A witty jester entertains the king with his jokes, all while subtly influencing the wealthy elite.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>A bright-eyed bard travels the land, learning new legends and singing songs of lost heroes.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>With his rapier and his feathered cap, a dashing swashbuckler is a danger to seedy criminals and lovelorn maidens... but for very different reasons.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Beast&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>Survival of the fittest: in the wilderness, this is the one and only law that matters. There are no morals, no civilized values only the strong and the dead, the predators and the prey. The wilderness is the ultimate crucible, forging beasts over millions of years into perfect killing machines. Their claws are sharper than swords; their scales are thicker than plate armor. What warriors spend decades training to master, predators already know by instinct. Their advanced adaptations gills, wings, and enhanced senses ensure that no prey ever escape their constant hunger. You are the product of countless generations, a finely-honed creature crafted by mother nature herself to do one thing: survive. It is now your turn to survive the trial of blood and fang.

Is it the mighty swordsman who can defeat any other foe in single combat? Is it the clever wizard who has mastered thousands of spells? Is it the crafty rogue who can go anywhere unnoticed? No-the most powerful man alive is whoever has the biggest army. Commanders and kings understand that power doesn&#39;t lie in trivial things like swordplay or magic. It lies in people. It lies in loyalty. It lies in the ability to issue a single command and watch as your army burns your enemy&#39;s kingdom to the ground. You can wield such power. By mastering diplomacy and statecraft, you can amass an army like the world has never seen.

These engines of destruction carve paths of terror through the land, annihilating whole armies and burning the countryside. Mortals who dare oppose dragons are reduced to cinders, while those with the wisdom to offer dragons tribute can bask in their draconic patron&#39;s glory.

Earthen mountains reach into the clouds, humbling even the tallest manmade tower. Air creates wind-tossed thunderstorms that steal the warmth from the living. Water is the origin and sustainer of all life, so much so that it flows through our veins. Fire consumes all, bringing complete destruction to anything it touches.
