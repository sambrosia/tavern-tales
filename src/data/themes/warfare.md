Warriors make history. They're the ones who slay dragons, who dethrone kings, who stand tall among the brutal carnage of a blood-soaked battlefield and raise their swords in triumph. Some of these men-at-arms have humble origins, taking up weapons in defense of home and family. Others pursue bloodshed as if they are born for it, traveling the land to train under exotic blademasters and master tacticians. Regardless of their past, all warriors follow the one universal truth of combat: kill your opponent before he kills you. And they're damned good at it. Every veteran warrior carries remnants of his past triumphs-each scar a reminder of a wound that could have been his last, each notch in his sword a lesson learned in the importance of precise swordplay. Even now, countless warriors are training for the day when they meet you in battle. Will you be strong enough to vanquish them? Take up arms, warrior, and prove to the world that today is not your day to die!
