Is there any force in the world more powerful than the primal elements? Earthen mountains reach into the clouds, humbling even the tallest manmade tower. Air creates wind-tossed thunderstorms that steal the warmth from the living. Water is the origin and sustainer of all life, so much so that it flows through our veins. Fire consumes all, bringing complete destruction to anything it touches. Look inside yourself, brave elementalist. Which elements rage within your soul?

* A frost witch lives in solitude in her ice castle and freezes any who dare approach.

* Born of the earth itself, a tough explorer delves into the earth's deepest caves for exotic gems.

* A raging storm gains sentience, coalescing into human form with piercing blue eyes and cloud-white skin.
