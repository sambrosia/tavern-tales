name: Undeath
---

For some, death is only the beginning. These undead push aside the dirt and slowly climb from their dark graves as flesh peels from their bones. Their tortured souls materialize and hover in the air, as if a cold, blue flame suddenly ignited. They awake on the tables of cruel necromancers and feel an unnatural hunger twist their stomachs. Undead wander the land with a single-minded purpose, incessantly searching to fulfill some dark desire. What is it that ripped you back from the blissful rest of afterlife? Was it unfinished business? Dark magic? An eternal hunger for human flesh? Whatever drives you, the living shall have no respite. Death has come for them.
