Survival of the fittest: in the wilderness, this is the one and only law that matters. There are no morals, no civilized values only the strong and the dead, the predators and the prey. The wilderness is the ultimate crucible, forging beasts over millions of years into perfect killing machines. Their claws are sharper than swords; their scales are thicker than plate armor. What warriors spend decades training to master, predators already know by instinct. Their advanced adaptations gills, wings, and enhanced senses ensure that no prey ever escape their constant hunger. You are the product of countless generations, a finely-honed creature crafted by mother nature herself to do one thing: survive. It is now your turn to survive the trial of blood and fang. Will you be the hunter, or the hunted?

* Given sentience by a druid, an intelligent wolf hunts the human trappers who butchered his pack.

* A shaman draws power from her spirit animal, an ethereal bear that has protected her bloodline for generations.

* A naga, a terrifying hybrid of man and serpent, raids coastal fishing villages to secure bloody sacrifices for his shark-toothed god.
