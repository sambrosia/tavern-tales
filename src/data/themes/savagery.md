Might makes right! Don't agree? Try arguing that point after someone stronger than you mounts your head on a pike. Savage warriors embrace the primordial rule of survival of the fittest, relying on instinct and brute strength to destroy their enemies. Some weak-willed people think that civilization leads to safety, but the truth is that laws make men docile. Real power comes from raw, unbridled rage-that roiling fury that makes you want to flip over a table and gouge someone's eyes out. What makes your blood boil, mighty warrior? Are you enraged by the injustices of corrupt societies? Do you sneer defiantly at the sight of a hulking, bloodthirsty monster? Then lift your weapon and show your enemies the true meaning of power!
