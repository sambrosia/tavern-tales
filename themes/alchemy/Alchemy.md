# Alchemy

Many see alchemy as the study of matter; others view alchemy as the study of change. In truth, both are correct, for alchemy is the study of everything. What doesn’t fall within its domain? Everything in the universe — from the tiniest speck of dust to the massive, ever-burning sun — owes its existence to chemistry. If matter and energy are the building blocks of reality, then alchemists are grand cosmic architects who rival even the gods themselves in their mastery over the physical world. Alchemists destroy matter in a way that would humble even the most fearsome warlord, breaking down objects into their most fundamental pieces. Alchemists create new wonders in ways that artists could never hope to match, brewing new chemicals that were heretofore unseen. When you understand the inner workings of the universe, the possibilities are endless: you could bottle sunlight, brew glory, or even unlock the hidden process for turning lead into gold. So, master chemist, what will you brew into your next bubbling concoction? 

Examples of alchemy characters include:


* A hermit lives in the swamp, where he brews fish eyes, pickled fireflies, and muddy water into potent elixirs.

* A chemist travels the world in search of rare and exotic materials to create the elixir of eternal youth.

* Hidden in her secret lair, an assassin creates deadly poisons for her next kill.
