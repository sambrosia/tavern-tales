# Dragon

 

There is no creature more legendary, more powerful, more feared, more awe-inspiring than the dragon. These engines of destruction carve paths of terror through the land, annihilating whole armies and burning the countryside. Mortals who dare oppose dragons are reduced to cinders, while those with the wisdom to offer dragons tribute can bask in their draconic patron's glory. Spread your wings and set the sky aflame, mighty dragon! Prove to the world that your power is unmatched!
