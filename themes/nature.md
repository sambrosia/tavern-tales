Man against nature-it is a popular theme in countless legends and bardic songs. Sometimes the hero can brave the untamed wilderness, but other times the waves swallow his ship whole, or the unforgiving cold of the frigid north drains the warmth from the hero's veins. As civilizations struggle against the ever-encroaching wilderness, the druids and the mystics of the world ask, "Why fight it at all?" These naturalists empower themselves with the vibrant life that courses through massive trees. They master the endless cycle of life and death, ensuring prosperity for their allies and death for their foes. They commune with an ancient, primordial force that has thrived since the dawn of time. What choice will you make? Will you fight for survival against the wilderness? Or will you join with it and harness the power of nature itself?
