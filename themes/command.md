Who is it the most powerful person alive? Is it the mighty swordsman who can defeat any other foe in single combat? Is it the clever wizard who has mastered thousands of spells? Is it the crafty rogue who can go anywhere unnoticed? No-the most powerful man alive is whoever has the biggest army. Commanders and kings understand that power doesn't lie in trivial things like swordplay or magic. It lies in people. It lies in loyalty. It lies in the ability to issue a single command and watch as your army burns your enemy's kingdom to the ground. You can wield such power. By mastering diplomacy and statecraft, you can amass an army like the world has never seen. Rally an army to your side, lord commander, and lead your people to war!
