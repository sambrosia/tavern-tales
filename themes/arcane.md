There are some who seek to look beyond the veil to unravel the mysteries of the universe, unlocking ancient power that was never intended to fall into mortal hands. These masters of the arcane arts bend the universe to their will by breaking the laws of physics and inventing new laws at whim. They fling fireballs as easily as an archer might launch an arrow. They warp space and time to create portals that span across continents. They bind their enemies under powerful spells to leave them as helpless as newborn kittens. Do you dare to rip apart the fabric of spacetime to tinker with reality? Unfathomable power awaits those foolish or brave enough to try.
