Mind, body, and spirit: these are the three components of self. To find harmony between them is to achieve oneness with the universe. When that happens, all is possible: the body grows as tough as iron and as fluid as the wind; the mind discovers perfect clarity; the soul achieves supreme enlightenment. Meditate on your purpose, young disciple, and behold your infinite potential.

* In a temple nestled high atop a mountain, a monk practices martial arts to achieve enlightenment.

* A nameless warrior wanders the countryside, dispensing ancient wisdom to all those willing to listen.

* A dwarf spends his evenings in the local tavern and wrestles anybody who looks at him the wrong way.
