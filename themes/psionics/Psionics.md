# Psionics

A mind is a terrible thing to waste. This is especially true when you can use your mind to read thoughts, levitate objects, and force choke all who dare oppose you. Such is the power of psions, who turn their energy inward to unlock the infinite potential of their own minds. They sharpen their wit the same way warriors sharpen their blades, transforming their raw intellects into deadly weapons capable of crushing skulls with a simple thought. They fortify their willpower the same way a blacksmith tempers steel armor, building an impenetrable defense that transcending physical limitations. Look inside yourself, psion, and behold the awesome power that lies dormant within you. What fragments of your power will you awaken first?
